# Task Recur

A Task Management app build with React. TaskRecur let's you create daily, weekly or monthly tasks. Tasks can be one of two types: standard or recurring. Recurring tasks reappear on your board after the given time frame has elapsed, either the current day, week or month. When standard tasks are marked as complete they are permanently archived and never reappear on your board.
